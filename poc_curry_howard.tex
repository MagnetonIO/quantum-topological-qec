\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present a proof-of-concept (PoC) framework in Haskell that implements proof sketches using the Curry–Howard correspondence. Our work provides a type-theoretic foundation for universal invariants as they apply to error correction. In particular, we develop several Haskell modules that encode:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item The definition of basic types and universal invariants,
  \item Error correction mechanisms that mimic type-safe correction,
  \item Braiding operations from topological quantum codes,
  \item Proof normalization via type-level rewriting, and
  \item Functorial mappings from local error processes to topological invariants.
\end{enumerate}
These modules illustrate how type-level programming and categorical abstractions can be leveraged to reason about quantum information and error correction in a constructive, proof-guided manner. We discuss the mathematical background, the Curry–Howard correspondence, and potential applications across diverse industries.

\section{Introduction}

Error correction is at the core of reliable computation, both classical and quantum. In recent years, universal invariants from topology and category theory have emerged as promising tools for encoding and protecting information against noise. The Curry–Howard correspondence reveals a deep equivalence between proofs and programs---suggesting that error correction can be modeled as the normalization of a “proof” that a system’s state is valid.

In this paper, we describe a Haskell-based proof-of-concept that demonstrates how type-level programming can capture universal invariants and error correction in a functorial framework. We organize our implementation into the following modules:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Module \arabic*:}, leftmargin=*, labelsep=1em]
  \item \textbf{TypesAndInvariants.hs} --- Defines basic types, invariants, and data-level representations.
  \item \textbf{ErrorCorrection.hs} --- Encodes error detection and correction functions as type-level proofs.
  \item \textbf{Braiding.hs} --- Models braiding operations corresponding to anyonic exchanges and error propagation.
  \item \textbf{ProofNormalization.hs} --- Implements normalization of proofs (error correction routines) via type-level rewriting.
  \item \textbf{FunctorialMapping.hs} --- Provides functorial mappings from local error processes to global invariants.
\end{enumerate}

Each module not only serves as executable Haskell code but also as a constructive proof that our system respects the desired invariants. The remainder of this paper explains the mathematical foundations and describes the code in detail.

\section{Mathematical Background}

Our approach builds on several mathematical pillars:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Curry–Howard Correspondence:} Establishes an isomorphism between proofs and programs. Under this view, types represent propositions, and functions are proofs. Error correction then corresponds to transforming an invalid proof into a valid one.
  \item \textbf{Universal Invariants:} Invariants such as the Drinfel’d center capture topological features that remain invariant under error processes. In our implementation, these invariants are encoded in the type system.
  \item \textbf{Braided Monoidal Categories:} Topological quantum codes leverage braiding to perform error correction. Braiding operations are represented as morphisms between types.
  \item \textbf{Functoriality:} A functor maps between categories preserving structure. In our case, it connects local error processes with global invariants.
\end{itemize}

The following sections describe our Haskell modules and explain the proofs and mathematics embedded within the code.

\newpage

\section{Module 1: TypesAndInvariants.hs}

This module lays the foundation by defining the types that represent quantum states and universal invariants. We use \texttt{DataKinds} and \texttt{GADTs} to capture type-level information.

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{File: TypesAndInvariants.hs}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell, caption={TypesAndInvariants.hs}]
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds, GADTs, KindSignatures, TypeOperators, TypeFamilies #-}

module TypesAndInvariants where

-- Define a kind for error states
data ErrorState = NoError | ZError | XError | YError

-- A simple representation of a quantum bit (qubit) with an error state.
data Qubit (e :: ErrorState) where
  Qubit :: Qubit 'NoError

-- Universal invariant type: for our purposes, an invariant is a type-level marker
data Invariant = Inv

-- A type class representing a universal invariant.
class UniversalInvariant a where
  invariant :: a -> Invariant

instance UniversalInvariant (Qubit 'NoError) where
  invariant _ = Inv

-- We can extend this to a list of qubits or a register.
data Register (n :: *) where
  EmptyReg :: Register ()
  ConsReg  :: UniversalInvariant a => a -> Register b -> Register (a, b)

-- Example invariant for a register is simply a tuple of invariants.
registerInvariant :: Register n -> [Invariant]
registerInvariant EmptyReg      = []
registerInvariant (ConsReg q r) = invariant q : registerInvariant r
\end{lstlisting}

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{Discussion:}  
In \texttt{TypesAndInvariants.hs}, we define a simple qubit type parameterized by an error state. The \texttt{UniversalInvariant} class assigns an invariant (here trivially \texttt{Inv}) to a qubit that is error-free. Registers of qubits are also built as inductive types. This module embodies the idea that certain invariants (which here are encoded as type-level proofs) remain unchanged in the absence of errors.

\newpage

\section{Module 2: ErrorCorrection.hs}

This module sketches the idea of error detection and correction. We define functions that detect errors (represented at the type level) and “normalize” them into the correct state.

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{File: ErrorCorrection.hs}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell, caption={ErrorCorrection.hs}]
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds, GADTs, TypeOperators, FlexibleInstances #-}

module ErrorCorrection (correctQubit, Correctable(..)) where

import TypesAndInvariants

-- Type class for correctable states
class Correctable (e :: ErrorState) where
  correct :: Qubit e -> Qubit 'NoError

instance Correctable 'NoError where
  correct Qubit = Qubit

-- Assume for this PoC that any error state can be corrected to NoError.
instance Correctable 'ZError where
  correct _ = Qubit

instance Correctable 'XError where
  correct _ = Qubit

instance Correctable 'YError where
  correct _ = Qubit

-- A wrapper function to correct any qubit if possible.
correctQubit :: Correctable e => Qubit e -> Qubit 'NoError
correctQubit = correct
\end{lstlisting}

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{Discussion:}  
In \texttt{ErrorCorrection.hs}, the \texttt{Correctable} type class formalizes that a qubit in any error state (e.g., \texttt{'ZError'}) can be “corrected” to the error-free state \texttt{'NoError'}. Here, the correction function serves as a proof transformation—reminiscent of the Curry–Howard correspondence—where the erroneous type is rewritten into a valid one.

\newpage

\section{Module 3: Braiding.hs}

Braiding plays a crucial role in topological quantum codes. This module sketches a model of braiding operations as transformations on our qubit types.

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{File: Braiding.hs}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell, caption={Braiding.hs}]
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds, GADTs, TypeOperators #-}

module Braiding (braid, Braided(..)) where

import TypesAndInvariants

-- Define a type class for braiding operations.
class Braided a where
  braid :: a -> a

-- For our simple PoC, we define a braiding operation on a qubit.
-- The braid operation here is a placeholder for a non-trivial transformation.
instance Braided (Qubit 'NoError) where
  braid Qubit = Qubit

-- In a more detailed model, braid would carry type-level evidence of non-trivial braiding.
\end{lstlisting}

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{Discussion:}  
The \texttt{Braiding.hs} module defines a type class \texttt{Braided} whose \texttt{braid} function represents a braiding operation. In topological quantum codes, braiding anyons effects logical operations. Here, we use a trivial example where braiding preserves the invariant state. In a fuller model, the braiding operation would alter the proof object (i.e., the type) to record the topological transformation.

\newpage

\section{Module 4: ProofNormalization.hs}

Proof normalization is key in the Curry–Howard framework: it is the process of transforming a proof to its normal form (i.e., correcting errors). This module encodes normalization rules as Haskell functions.

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{File: ProofNormalization.hs}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell, caption={ProofNormalization.hs}]
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds, GADTs, TypeOperators #-}

module ProofNormalization (normalizeProof) where

import TypesAndInvariants
import ErrorCorrection

-- A simple normalization: given a qubit with an error, normalize it to the error-free state.
normalizeProof :: Correctable e => Qubit e -> Qubit 'NoError
normalizeProof = correctQubit

-- In a more advanced system, normalization would use type-level rewriting rules.
\end{lstlisting}

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{Discussion:}  
In \texttt{ProofNormalization.hs}, the \texttt{normalizeProof} function leverages the correction mechanism to “normalize” an erroneous qubit into a valid one. This is analogous to proof normalization in type theory, where an incorrect proof (or one with unnecessary detours) is rewritten into its canonical form.

\newpage

\section{Module 5: FunctorialMapping.hs}

This module demonstrates a functor that maps local error processes (represented as transformations on our qubit types) into global invariants. This illustrates how functoriality—the preservation of structure—is central to our framework.

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{File: FunctorialMapping.hs}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell, caption={FunctorialMapping.hs}]
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds, GADTs, TypeOperators, FlexibleInstances, MultiParamTypeClasses #-}

module FunctorialMapping (ErrorFunctor(..), mapError) where

import TypesAndInvariants
import ErrorCorrection

-- Define a functor class that maps from a local error state to a corrected invariant.
class ErrorFunctor f where
  fmapError :: (Correctable e) => f e -> Qubit 'NoError

-- Our local error functor wraps a qubit.
newtype LocalError e = LocalError { getQubit :: Qubit e }

instance ErrorFunctor LocalError where
  fmapError (LocalError q) = correctQubit q

-- A helper function to perform the mapping.
mapError :: (ErrorFunctor f, Correctable e) => f e -> Qubit 'NoError
mapError = fmapError
\end{lstlisting}

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{Discussion:}  
The \texttt{FunctorialMapping.hs} module defines an \texttt{ErrorFunctor} type class. Here, we model a local error process (wrapped in the \texttt{LocalError} newtype) that is mapped via the functor to an error-free state. This functorial mapping illustrates how local operations (error processes) can be transformed while preserving the invariant structure—akin to the mapping of local states to global topological invariants in TQFT.

\newpage

\section{Discussion and Future Work}

The modules presented above illustrate a simple yet conceptually rich PoC for modeling error correction via universal invariants using the Curry–Howard correspondence. Although our Haskell implementation is intentionally simplified, it provides a blueprint for:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Using type-level programming to encode error states and invariants,
  \item Implementing correction functions as proof transformations,
  \item Modeling braiding and functorial mappings as operations that preserve topological structure, and
  \item Enabling normalization of proofs to achieve error-free computation.
\end{itemize}

Future work will extend these modules to more sophisticated type-level constructs, including dependent types and homotopy type theory (HoTT) inspired proofs. We also plan to integrate this framework with automated proof assistants and develop domain-specific languages for robust error correction in quantum computing and classical coding theory.

\section{Conclusion}

We have presented a modular, Haskell-based framework that demonstrates how universal invariants and the Curry–Howard correspondence can be harnessed to model error correction. By decomposing the system into clearly defined modules—each corresponding to a fundamental mathematical and computational concept—we have provided a proof-of-concept that bridges the gap between abstract theory and executable code. This approach not only enriches our understanding of error correction but also offers promising avenues for practical applications across quantum computing, AI, cryptography, and beyond.
