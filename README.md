# quantum-topological-qec

Welcome to the Quantum Topological Quantum Error Correction (QEC) project! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of tools and resources for implementing topological quantum error correction codes in quantum computing. The project is designed to facilitate research and development in the realm of quantum error correction, a crucial aspect of quantum computing that ensures the reliability and fault tolerance of quantum circuits.

## Introduction

Quantum computers hold the promise of revolutionizing computing by exploiting the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations that are infeasible for classical computers. However, quantum systems are inherently fragile and prone to errors. Quantum error correction is a vital field of study that addresses these challenges by protecting quantum information from errors that arise due to noise and other sources of interference. Topological quantum error correction codes have emerged as a powerful approach to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation.

This project provides a set of tools and libraries to simulate, analyze, and implement topological quantum error correction codes. Key features of this project include:

- Simulation of quantum circuits using topological codes
- Visualization of logical qubit encoding and error correction
- Benchmarking tools for assessing the fault tolerance of quantum circuits
